# Welcome to Capture-the-Flag DevSecOps/Engineering challenge

Welcome, in this challenge, we'll provide an application, and we'd like you to propose and implement the best solution for its secure deployment.

### **We'd like to see your work experience and secure coding skills, so please update this repo with Your proposed solution**

The application depends on:
- A Client Side Render Frontend [repo here](https://github.com/4k4xs4pH1r3/DevSecOps/tree/master/Frontend)
- A Backend service [repo here](https://github.com/4k4xs4pH1r3/DevSecOps/tree/master/Backend)


# Evaluation rules

- Expectations and Objectives:
  
    - Both applications should run a fully working hosted version of your DevSecOps solution. But you are free to modify them as you see fit for the solution you wish to propose.
    - Use infrastructure as code IaC, a container-based solution that would implement the necessary resources for this app to work; AWS oriented is preferred but not mandatory.
    - Add all the missing GitHub Workflows, fix the existing ones, and add to each one their badges inside of this README file to identify the smell of Your code.
    - CI/CD pipeline proposition, using the last version of each component ever instead of pinning a specific version when possible.
    - Meaningful git commits; we'd like to see how you got to the final solution presented by sending the PRs to this repo.
    - Your solution must scale and be highly secure, clearing all the alerts in Security Tab.
    - Update the README file with information on the solution and how to operate it.
    - Create the Release and the Package.

# Extra points for:

- Create a Cyber Security architecture diagram in draw.io and add the google drive link to it here.
- How would you make sure this application won't fail during high loads and/or traffic?
- How would you design your solution for zero-downtime deployment and scale?
- Horizontal auto-scaling solution proposition.
- Feedback on the applications given.


Best of Luck!
